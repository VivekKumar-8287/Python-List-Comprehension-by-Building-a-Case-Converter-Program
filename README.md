# Python List Comprehension by Building a Case Converter Program
- List Comprehension is a way to construct a new Python list from an iterable types: lists, tuples, and strings. All without using a for loop or the `.append()` list method.
- In this project, i write a program that takes a string formatted in Camel Case or Pascal Case, then converts it into Snake Case.
- The project has two phases: first i use a for loop to implement the program. Then i use List Comprehension instead of a loop to achieve the same results.
